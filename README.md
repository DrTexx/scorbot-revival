# Scorbot Revival Project
## Background
I received two robot arms during my mechanical engineering diploma that were operated with DOS and interfaced with a DB9, DB25 and DB50 cables (standards that are since outdated).

My goal to is to create my own hardware and software to interface with the robots primary connector (a DB50 cable) without making any modifications to the robot's hardware itself.

Further, I hope to have the arms controllable via WiFi or other wireless means.
