# Scorbot Revival Project
## Background
I received two robot arms during my mechanical engineering diploma. They were controlled via DOS and interfaced with DB9, DB25 and DB50 cables (standards that are since very outdated).

With the help of the my close friends from the CCHS hackerspace, I'm working on designing my own hardware and software to interface with the robots primary connector (a DB50 cable) without making any modifications to the robot arm's hardware itself.

Further, I hope to have the arms controllable via WiFi or other wireless means.
